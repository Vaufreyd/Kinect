## RGBD Sync SDK

This RGBD Sync SDK is designed for file access to data (robot information, depth, infrared, video, bodies and faces from a Kinect2, ...) and easy way to read them synchronously
from separate sources almost like in ROS bag. 

The RGBD Sync SDK has been used to record the [MobileRGBD corpus](http://MobileRGBD.inrialpes.fr/). It is available for people who want
to work on this corpus, and anyone who need to use it within the term of the LICENSE.

## Kinect Folder

The Kinect folder contains data definition that permits to read data from the Kinect2 device under Linux and obviously Windows (not tested on Mac OSX).
Classes to record and/or process all data comming from the Kinect2 device are provided (Windows Only).
